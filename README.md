#  3D Model Viewer Backend

This repository contains the **backend server** for the [3D Model Viewer](https://github.com/himanshu-mauraya/3D-model-viewer) project — a full-stack 3D visualization platform that enables users to **upload, view, and customize 3D models** in real time.

The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, providing a secure REST API for authentication, 3D model management, and scene persistence.
